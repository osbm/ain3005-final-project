# AIN3005 - Advanced Python Programming - Final Project


The goal of this project is to implement a Library Automation System (LAS) using Flask as the web framework, MongoDB as the database, and Apache Kafka for messaging. The LAS will provide various services, including book lending, reservation, and search functionality.

Requirements:

- Flask Web Application: Implement a REST API to serve requirements you analyzed in the first homework for the Library Automation System.
- MongoDB Integration: Use MongoDB to store and manage data related to books, users, borrowing records, fines, and reservations.
- Apache Kafka Messaging: Integrate Apache Kafka for communication between different components of the LAS, ensuring reliable and scalable messaging.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Implement a user authentication system with roles (students, faculty members, staff, and graduates) to control access to LAS services. Implement JWT for secure user authentication and authorization. Each request to LAS services should be validated using JWT.


Notes:

- Include comprehensive documentation explaining the system architecture, database schema, and API endpoints.
- Clearly specify all dependencies and include a setup guide for easy replication of the environment.
- Provide a set of test cases to ensure the functionality of key features.
